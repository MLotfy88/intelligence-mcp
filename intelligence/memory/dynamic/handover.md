# Handover Log

This document records key decisions and milestones for the Roo Code Intelligence Server project.

- **[MILESTONE: Initial Setup Complete]** All basic project files, dependencies, and core server structure are in place.
- **[DECISION: MCP SDK Import Correction]** Resolved conflicting TypeScript errors by explicitly instantiating `StdioServerTransport` and correcting MCP SDK import paths.
- **[DECISION: Configuration Enhancement]** Added `default_compression_rate` to `priorities` in `Config` interface and `.roo/code-intelligence.yaml` to support context condensing.
- **[MILESTONE: Core Tools Integrated]** All six primary MCP tools (`code_intelligence_analyze`, `web_search_enhanced`, `memory_bank_manager`, `eslint_analysis`, `typescript_diagnostics`, `sequential_thinking_process`) have been defined and integrated into `src/tools/index.ts`.
- **[MILESTONE: Workflow Tools Added]** `daily_digest_generator` and `context_condensing_process` tools have been created and integrated into `master-workflow.ts`.
- **[DECISION: Structured Memory Implementation]** Initiated creation of the structured memory bank within `.roo/memory/` as per custom instructions.
