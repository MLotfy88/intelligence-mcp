# Active Context

This document stores the current active context and ongoing tasks for the Roo Code Intelligence Server.

**Current Task:** Implementing the full MCP Server according to custom instructions.

**Sub-tasks in progress:**
- Creating memory architecture files.
- Verifying configuration and dependencies.
- Integrating new workflow tools (daily digest, context condensing).

**Deferred Actions:**
- [DEFERRED] Fully resolve the MCP SDK type/API issues for `Server` and `StdioServerTransport` to ensure a clean build and full functionality. (Review after `behavior.deferred_actions.review_period` if applicable).

**Recent Interactions:**
- User feedback received regarding incomplete implementation of custom instructions, specifically conversation summarization, memory bank paths, and documentation.
- Created `project-plan.md` to outline remaining tasks.
- Corrected `StdioServerTransport` instantiation in `src/index.ts`.
- Updated `Config` interface and `.roo/code-intelligence.yaml` to include `default_compression_rate`.
- Added `daily-digest` and `context-condensing` tool definitions and updated `master-workflow.ts`.
