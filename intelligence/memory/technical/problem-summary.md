# Current Problem Summary: MCP Tool Access Failure

**Date:** 2025-06-08 21:57 UTC

## üö® Problem Description
The application successfully builds and the MCP server is live, as confirmed by the `/health` endpoint returning "OK". This holds true for both CI/CD environments and Render deployments, with no build or runtime errors reported. However, attempts to interact with MCP tools via the `/api/tool` endpoint, specifically using POST requests from external API testing platforms like `reqbin.com`, consistently fail with a `406 Not Acceptable` HTTP status code.

The server's error message explicitly states: "Client must accept both application/json and text/event-stream". This indicates a content negotiation issue where the server, utilizing `StreamableHTTPServerTransport`, expects the client to be capable of handling both JSON and Server-Sent Events (SSE) streams.

## üõ†Ô∏è Attempts and Outcomes

1.  **Linting Warnings Resolution:**
    *   **Action:** Addressed all `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` warnings across `src/tools/conversation-summarizer.ts`, `src/workflows/master-workflow.ts`, `src/tools/index.ts`, `src/types/eslint-integration.d.ts`, `src/workflows/context-condensing.ts`, and `src/workflows/daily-digest.ts`. Also fixed a `prefer-const` error in `src/workflows/master-workflow.ts`.
    *   **Outcome:** `npm run lint` now passes without these warnings/errors. This was a general code quality improvement and not directly related to the `406` error.

2.  **Health Endpoint Verification:**
    *   **Action:** Implemented a `/health` endpoint in `src/index.ts` to confirm server liveness.
    *   **Outcome:** The `/health` endpoint successfully returns "OK", confirming the server is running and accessible. This ruled out general server startup issues.

3.  **API Tool Endpoint Configuration:**
    *   **Action:** Configured `src/index.ts` to handle `POST` requests to `/api/tool` and route them through the `StreamableHTTPServerTransport`.
    *   **Outcome:** The endpoint is recognized, but the `406` error persists, indicating a deeper issue than just endpoint availability.

4.  **CORS `allowedHeaders` Modification:**
    *   **Action:** Added `'Accept'` to the `allowedHeaders` in the CORS configuration within `src/index.ts` to explicitly permit the `Accept` header.
    *   **Outcome:** The `406 Not Acceptable` error continued, suggesting that simply allowing the header was not sufficient; the server's transport mechanism has specific expectations for how the `Accept` header is used in conjunction with the request.

5.  **Client-Side `Accept` Header Configuration (on `reqbin.com`):**
    *   **Action:** Instructed the user to manually set the `Accept` header to `application/json, text/event-stream` in `reqbin.com`.
    *   **Outcome:** The user confirmed this was done, but the `406 Not Acceptable` error persisted. This strongly suggests that `reqbin.com` (or similar non-streaming clients) cannot fully satisfy the `StreamableHTTPServerTransport`'s requirements for a streaming connection, even with the correct `Accept` header. The server expects a streaming client, and `reqbin.com` is likely not behaving as one for a `POST` request.

6.  **Attempted `curl` for testing:**
    *   **Action:** Provided a `curl` command to test the `/api/tool` endpoint with precise header control, as `curl` can often handle streaming contexts better.
    *   **Outcome:** The user stated they could not run `curl`.

7.  **Attempted to switch `StreamableHTTPServerTransport` to `HTTPServerTransport`:**
    *   **Action:** Proposed modifying `src/index.ts` to use `HTTPServerTransport` (a more general HTTP transport) instead of `StreamableHTTPServerTransport`, hypothesizing that the latter's strict streaming requirements were the root cause of the `406` error with non-streaming clients.
    *   **Outcome:** This operation was denied by the user. This is a critical blocker as it prevents testing a potential solution to the core `406` issue.

## üí° Current Hypothesis
The `406 Not Acceptable` error, despite correct `Accept` header configuration, is likely due to the `StreamableHTTPServerTransport`'s inherent design for Server-Sent Events (SSE) or other streaming protocols. Standard HTTP clients like `reqbin.com` may not fully emulate the necessary streaming behavior for `POST` requests, leading the server to reject the connection. The server is effectively stating that while the client *claims* to accept `text/event-stream`, its actual connection behavior does not meet the transport's streaming expectations.

## ‚û°Ô∏è Next Steps
To definitively diagnose and resolve this, we need to either:
1.  **Test with a client that fully supports `text/event-stream` for POST requests.** This would ideally be a custom client or a tool known for robust SSE support.
2.  **Switch the server's transport to a more general HTTP transport** (e.g., `HTTPServerTransport` if available in the SDK) that is less strict about streaming capabilities for non-streaming requests. This was the last attempted solution that was denied.

Without the ability to test with a true streaming client or modify the server's transport, further debugging of the `406` error becomes challenging.
