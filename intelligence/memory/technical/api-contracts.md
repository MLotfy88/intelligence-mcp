# API Contracts and Design Principles

This document outlines the core API contracts and design principles for the IntelliCodeMCP project. All proposed code changes must adhere to these guidelines to ensure system stability, compatibility, and maintainability.

## 1. Naming Conventions
- **Classes:** PascalCase (e.g., `MyClass`)
- **Functions/Methods:** camelCase (e.g., `myFunction`)
- **Variables:** camelCase (e.g., `myVariable`)
- **Constants:** SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MY_CONSTANT`)

## 2. Type Safety
- All TypeScript code must use explicit types where possible.
- Avoid `any` type unless absolutely necessary and justified.
- Interfaces and types should be defined for all data structures passed between modules or APIs.

## 3. Error Handling
- All asynchronous operations must include proper error handling (e.g., `try-catch` blocks, Promise rejections).
- Errors should be logged with sufficient detail (timestamp, error message, stack trace).
- User-facing errors should be clear and actionable.

## 4. Modularity and Separation of Concerns
- Code should be organized into logical modules, each with a single responsibility.
- Avoid tight coupling between modules.
- Tools and workflows should be clearly separated.

## 5. Performance Considerations
- Optimize critical paths for performance.
- Avoid unnecessary computations or redundant data processing.
- Consider caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data.

## 6. Security
- Sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- Protect sensitive data (e.g., API keys) using environment variables or secure configuration management.
- Implement proper authentication and authorization where applicable.

## 7. Documentation
- All public functions, classes, and interfaces must have JSDoc comments explaining their purpose, parameters, and return values.
- Key architectural decisions and complex logic should be documented in markdown files within the `intelligence/memory/technical/` directory.

## 8. Backward Compatibility
- Major API changes should be versioned.
- Minor changes should strive for backward compatibility.
