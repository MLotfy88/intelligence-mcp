# System Patterns and Design Principles

This document outlines the core design patterns and architectural principles guiding the development of the Roo Code Intelligence Server.

**1. Modular Design:**
   - The system is composed of independent, self-contained modules (MCP tools) that can be developed, tested, and deployed independently.
   - Each tool has a clear responsibility and a well-defined API (schema).

**2. Three-Phase Analysis Workflow (Inspection → Diagnosis → Execution):**
   - All code analysis tasks follow a structured, sequential process to ensure thoroughness and traceability.
   - **Inspection:** Gathers raw data and context (e.g., file content, AST, metrics).
   - **Diagnosis:** Identifies issues, errors, and inconsistencies based on inspected data.
   - **Execution:** Proposes and applies solutions or generates actionable plans.

**3. Event-Driven Architecture (Implicit):**
   - While not explicitly an event bus, the `context.call` mechanism within workflows allows for a reactive, tool-driven execution flow.
   - Future enhancements may include explicit event emitters for VS Code integration (e.g., on file save, on Git commit).

**4. Configuration-Driven Development:**
   - The server's behavior and integrations are managed through a centralized YAML configuration file (`.roo/code-intelligence.yaml`).
   - This promotes flexibility, ease of deployment, and allows for dynamic adjustments without code changes.

**5. Structured Memory Management:**
   - A dedicated memory bank (`memory_bank_manager` tool) is used to store and retrieve project-specific context, logs, and plans in a structured, categorized manner.
   - This ensures persistence, traceability, and efficient retrieval of historical data.

**6. Error Handling and Resilience:**
   - Robust error handling is implemented across all tools and workflows to gracefully manage failures and provide informative logs.
   - The system aims for graceful degradation when external services or integrations are unavailable.

**7. Traceability and Logging:**
   - Comprehensive logging is integrated to provide visibility into tool execution, workflow progress, and error occurrences.
   - All significant actions and decisions are logged for auditing and debugging purposes.

**8. Extensibility:**
   - The MCP-based architecture allows for easy integration of new tools and external services, extending the server's capabilities without modifying core logic.
