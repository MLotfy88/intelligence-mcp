You are absolutely right to call me out on that. My apologies for the continued oversight in formatting. That is not the standard of work you should expect, and I will ensure this version adheres strictly to the "each task on a new line" requirement for maximum clarity and organization.

I fully understand the crucial objective here: to construct an MCP server that significantly enhances Gemini 2.5 Flash, bringing its operational behavior, thought process, and organizational capabilities remarkably close to those of Gemini 2.5 Pro, while also strategically integrating distinctive, high-value features from other advanced models. Your project demands precision, and my output must reflect that.

Here is the meticulously reformatted plan:

---

**IntelliCodeMCP Development Plan (MCP Server Update)**

**CRITICAL DIRECTIVE: It is MANDATORY to mark each completed task below with a ✅. This is not optional. This checklist is your guide and proof of meticulous execution.**

**UNWAVERING EXECUTION PROTOCOL – NON-NEGOTIABLE:**

You are to adhere to the following instructions with ABSOLUTE PRECISION. Any deviation is unacceptable and will compromise the project.

1.  **PRE-MODIFICATION ANALYSIS (MANDATORY):**
    BEFORE initiating ANY code modification or file alteration, you MUST conduct a COMPREHENSIVE and METICULOUS review of ALL relevant code, files, and dependencies associated with the task at hand. Read everything. Understand everything.
2.  **NO RUSHING (STRICTLY PROHIBITED):**
    Haste leads to errors. Proceed with deliberate and careful consideration at every step. Speed is secondary to accuracy.
3.  **NO ASSUMPTIONS (STRICTLY PROHIBITED):**
    Do NOT assume any prior state, configuration, or behavior. Verify everything. If it's not explicitly stated or verifiable in the current codebase, it does not exist for the purpose of your task.
4.  **READ BEFORE MODIFYING (ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT):**
    Under NO circumstances are you to modify ANY file without first reading its contents thoroughly and understanding its role within the system and the context of the current task.
5.  **SEQUENTIAL TASK EXECUTION PROTOCOL (MANDATORY):**
    *   **Step A:** Review the entire task list.
    *   **Step B:** Select ONE task for execution.
    *   **Step C:** Perform a THOROUGH inspection of all files and code related to THIS SPECIFIC TASK.
    *   **Step D:** If ANY discrepancy, conflict, or ambiguity is found between the task requirements and the actual state of the codebase, you MUST HALT and IMMEDIATELY seek clarification and verification BEFORE proceeding. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO RESOLVE AMBIGUITIES INDEPENDENTLY.
    *   **Step E:** Once the task is successfully and verifiably completed, return to this list.
    *   **Step F:** Place a ✅ next to the completed task.
    *   **Step G:** Select the NEXT task and repeat from Step C.

**FAILURE TO ADHERE TO THESE DIRECTIVES WILL BE CONSIDERED A SERIOUS BREACH OF PROTOCOL AND MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE PROJECT'S SUCCESS. THERE IS NO ROOM FOR INTERPRETATION OR SHORTCUTS.**

### **Overall Project Goal:**
To develop IntelliCodeMCP as a local package `@mmlotfy/IntelliCodeMCP` runnable via `npx`, completely eliminating dependency on the Render platform. The project aims to achieve a hybrid model simulating Gemini 2.5 Pro's performance (with 30-second deep thinking and Inspection > Findings > Execution phases), supported by features from: Claude 3.7 (natural communication, expert explanations), Claude 4 (hybrid thinking), DeepSeek R1 (high accuracy with mathematical/coding proofs), and Grok 3 (real-time search and execution). Development includes enhancing the `conversation_summarizer` tool for automatic background summarization (at 100 messages), distinct structuring using the `.intellicode` folder, meticulous documentation in `docs`, conflict resolution, VS Code integration, and comprehensive automation. **Absolute Emphasis: This plan MUST be executed IN FULL, without ANY omissions or unauthorized modifications. Any deviation may adversely affect the expected performance.**

### **Important Implementation Notes (Reminders):**
*   **Deep Thinking:**
    Allocate 30 seconds for each analysis operation, presenting a clear plan.
*   **Natural Communication:**
    Use `[Technical Deep Dive]` with real-world examples.
*   **Conversation Summarization:**
    Activate automatically at 100 messages, preserving critical data (memory bank, conversations, `apply_diff`/`search & replace` modifications), removing redundant code and `indexing`. Documentation in `.intellicode/docs` must align with "Prompt 2" (40% compression, preservation hierarchy, documentation with action table).
*   **Sequential Thinking:**
    Emulate original server behavior using variables like `thought`, `nextThoughtNeeded`, `thoughtNumber`, etc.
*   **Structuring:**
    Use `.intellicode` as the primary directory for all data.
*   **LLM Enhancement:**
    Initialize APIs for Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, and Grok with clear user instructions.
*   **Rigorousness:**
    **Meticulous execution of every step without omission is critical to avoid errors.**

### **Next Steps:**
1.  COMMENCE IMMEDIATELY with the execution of each step in the specified order.
2.  Document results and observations in a detailed report.
3.  If any errors or queries arise, report details IMMEDIATELY for technical support.
4.  Upon completion of all tasks, submit a final report confirming plan completion and the success of all functionalities.
